# Mixtape — Codebase Map

## Main files and their responsibilities

**`app.py`** — Application factory (`create_app`). Configures the SQLAlchemy
DB URI (env `DATABASE_URL`, defaults to local sqlite file), initializes the
`db` extension, registers all four blueprints under their URL prefixes
(`/songs`, `/playlists`, `/users`, `/feed`), and calls `db.create_all()` at
startup. `db = SQLAlchemy()` lives here (not in `models.py`) — `models.py`
imports `db` back from `app.py`, so `app.py` must be importable without
circular-importing the models. This is also why `python app.py` breaks
(double import of `app` under two different module names, `__main__` vs
`app`) and `flask run` with `FLASK_APP=app:create_app` is the required entry
point — it only imports the module once, as `app`.

**`models.py`** — All SQLAlchemy models and association tables:
- `User` — has `listening_streak` / `last_listened_at` columns directly on
  the row (not a separate streak table), plus a symmetric self-referential
  `friends` many-to-many via the `friendships` table.
- `Song` — `shared_by` (FK to User) + `shared_at` records who shared a song
  and when. Tags are many-to-many via `song_tags`.
- `ListeningEvent` — one row per (user, song, timestamp) "user listened to
  song X at time T" — this is what both the streak logic and the feeds
  are built from.
- `Rating` — one row per (user, song) with a `UniqueConstraint`, so a
  second rating from the same user updates rather than duplicates.
- `Playlist` — songs are attached via `playlist_entries`, a many-to-many
  table that (unlike `song_tags`) carries extra columns: `position`,
  `added_by`, `added_at`. Position is what gives playlists an explicit
  order instead of relying on insertion/PK order.
- `Notification` — generic `notification_type` + `body` string, no
  polymorphic subtype — every notification is just a row with a type tag
  and a pre-rendered message.

**`routes/`** — One blueprint per resource (`songs`, `playlists`, `users`,
`feed`). Every handler follows the same shape: parse `request.args` /
`request.get_json()`, call exactly one service function, catch `ValueError`
and turn it into a `400`/`404` JSON error, otherwise `jsonify(...)`. No
business logic lives here.

**`services/`** — All business logic, one module per feature area:
- `streak_service.py` — `record_listening_event` (create a `ListeningEvent`
  + update streak) and `update_listening_streak` (the day-diff math).
- `feed_service.py` — `get_friends_listening_now` (last 24h, deduped to one
  entry per friend) and `get_activity_feed` (last N events, no time filter).
- `search_service.py` — `search_songs` (title/artist `ILIKE` match) and
  `get_song`.
- `notification_service.py` — generic `create_notification`, plus
  `add_to_playlist` and `rate_song`, which are two_places business actions
  live (not just notification creation — `add_to_playlist` also mutates
  the playlist, and `rate_song` also mutates the `Rating` row).
- `playlist_service.py` — playlist CRUD-ish reads: `create_playlist`,
  `get_playlist`, `get_playlist_songs`, `get_user_playlists`.

**`seed_data.py`** — Drops and recreates all tables, then inserts 5 users
(with friendships), 25 songs (with deliberately varying tag counts — 0, 1,
3+ — the multi-tag songs are explicitly called out as the ones that
exercise Issue #3), 3 playlists, a mix of recent (~10–20 min old) and old
(hours-to-days old) `ListeningEvent`s, per-user `last_listened_at`
snapshots, and one known-good "song added to playlist" notification. It's
worth noting the seed comments directly telegraph which data exists to
expose which issue — e.g. "Older events... should NOT appear in listening
now after fix" implies the current behavior does show them.

**`tests/`** — `test_streaks.py`, `test_search.py`, `test_playlists.py`.
These aren't just regression tests; several assertions describe the
*intended* behavior that the current code doesn't satisfy yet (e.g.
`test_streak_increments_on_sunday` explicitly asserts a Saturday→Sunday
listen should increment the streak to 2). Running `pytest tests/` before
touching any service is effectively a pre-built list of which behaviors
are currently broken.

## Data flow — a user rates a song

1. Client sends `POST /songs/<song_id>/rate` with JSON body
   `{user_id, score}`.
2. `routes/songs.py:rate()` parses the body, validates presence of
   `user_id`/`score`, and calls `notification_service.rate_song(user_id,
   song_id, int(score))`.
3. `rate_song()` (in `notification_service.py`, not `search_service.py` —
   ratings live alongside notifications because rating is meant to also
   notify someone) validates the score is 1–5, loads the `Song` and rater
   `User`, and checks for an existing `Rating` row for that
   (user_id, song_id) pair — if found it updates the score in place
   (enforced uniquely by the DB's `UniqueConstraint`), otherwise inserts
   a new `Rating`. It commits and returns the `Rating`.
4. Contrast with `add_to_playlist()` in the same file: after mutating the
   playlist, it explicitly calls `create_notification(...)` to notify the
   song's original sharer ("X added your song to playlist Y"). `rate_song`
   has no equivalent call — nothing in the rate path ever creates a
   `Notification` row, so the sharer is never told their song was rated.
   This matches the way the route layer treats the two actions
   identically (both are just a `POST` that calls one service function and
   returns 201) — the asymmetry is entirely inside `notification_service.py`.
5. `routes/songs.py` serializes the `Rating` via `.to_dict()` and returns
   `201`.

So: rating a song *does* persist correctly and *does* return a valid
response — the missing piece is purely the notification side-effect that
the parallel `add_to_playlist` flow has and `rate_song` doesn't.

## Patterns noticed

- **Routes are pure adapters.** Every route: parse input → call one
  service function → catch `ValueError` → `jsonify`. There is no ORM usage,
  no business rule, and no direct `db.session` call in any route file
  (except `users.py`'s `get_user`, which reads a single row directly rather
  than going through a service — the one inconsistency in an otherwise
  strict layering).
- **Errors are `ValueError` + a message, uniformly.** Services never raise
  custom exception types; routes never do their own existence checks —
  they let the service raise and translate `ValueError` to 400 or 404
  depending on the endpoint's semantics (400 for "bad input to a write",
  404 for "resource doesn't exist").
- **`to_dict()` lives on the model, not the service or route.** Serialization
  shape is defined once per model and reused everywhere that model is
  returned.
- **Many-to-many tables are used for two different purposes.** `song_tags`
  and `friendships` are plain association tables (existence = relationship).
  `playlist_entries` is an association table *with data* (`position`,
  `added_by`, `added_at`) — it's really an entity in its own right, just
  modeled as a many-to-many secondary table instead of its own model class.
  Any query that joins through `playlist_entries` needs to be careful about
  row multiplication / ordering in a way that `song_tags` joins don't,
  since `song_tags` join fan-out only affects `tags`, but joining a Song
  query directly against `song_tags` can duplicate the base `Song` rows
  when a song has more than one tag.
- **Cross-imports between services are local, not top-level.** e.g.
  `notification_service.add_to_playlist` does `from services.playlist_service
  import get_playlist_songs` (unused after import, actually) and `from
  models import Playlist` inside the function body rather than at module
  top — likely to avoid circular imports, since `playlist_service.py`
  doesn't import `notification_service.py` but the reverse does.
- **Time handling is UTC-first but defensive about naive datetimes.**
  `streak_service.update_listening_streak` explicitly reattaches
  `timezone.utc` to `user.last_listened_at` if it comes back naive
  (e.g. from sqlite, which doesn't preserve tzinfo), suggesting this bit
  everyone once already.

## The five open issues (read, not yet fixed)

| # | Title | Service | Notes from reading |
|---|-------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | Listening streak keeps resetting | `streak_service.py` | `update_listening_streak` has a `today.weekday() != 6` condition gating the increment branch — on a Sunday, a legitimate consecutive-day listen falls through to the reset branch instead. Confirmed by the existing (failing) test `test_streak_increments_on_sunday`. |
| 2 | Friends Listening Now shows people from yesterday | `feed_service.py` | `get_friends_listening_now` filters by `RECENT_THRESHOLD = timedelta(hours=24)` against `now`. Looks structurally correct at a glance; needs closer tracing against how `listened_at` is stored/compared (naive vs aware) before concluding where the 24h boundary actually leaks. |
| 3 | Same song shows up twice in search | `search_service.py` | `search_songs` does an `outerjoin` against `song_tags` directly on the `Song` query, then `.all()`s the `Song` rows with no dedup — a song with N tags will join-fan-out into N duplicate rows. Seed data explicitly creates multi-tag songs to expose this. |
| 4 | Notified for playlist-add but not for rating | `notification_service.py` | `add_to_playlist` calls `create_notification(...)` after mutating the playlist; `rate_song` has no equivalent call anywhere in its body. Traced in the data flow above. |
| 5 | Last song in a playlist never shows up | `playlist_service.py` | `get_playlist_songs` builds the correctly-ordered `songs` list, then returns `songs[:-1]` — an off-by-one slice that drops the last element every time. |

## Rough plan

All five root causes are now understood well enough to fix, but per the
brief only three are required. Issues #1 (single boolean condition), #4
(single missing function call), and #5 (single slice bug) are the most
surgical, one-line-root-cause fixes with existing tests/seed data to verify
against, so they're the strongest first three. Issue #3 needs a `.distinct()`
or restructured query rather than a one-line change, and Issue #2 needs more
tracing before the actual defect is clear — good candidates for a second
pass.
